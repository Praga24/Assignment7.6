1. Write a macro in pig to filter out the people with age >45 from the below given dataset.

DEFINE macr(relvar,colvar) returns res{

$res = filter $relvar by $colvar > 45;

};

a = LOAD '/home/acadgild/olympix_data.csv' USING PigStorage(',') as (name:chararray, age:int, country:chararray, year:chararray,
close_date:chararray, sport:chararray, gold_medal:int, silver_medal:int, bronze_medal:int, total:int);

x1 = macr(a,age);
dump x1;
